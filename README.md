This is some of my work from Computer Science I at RPI which I took my fall semester freshman year. This course was an introductory computer science course teaching python, and basic programming skills/algorithms. 

Course Description: An introduction to computer programming algorithm design and analysis. Additional topics include basic computer organization; internal representation of scalar and array data; use of top-down design and subprograms to tackle complex problems; abstract data types.
